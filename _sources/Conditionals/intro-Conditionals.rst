Intro: What we can do with Conditionals
===================================================

So far, our programs have either been a series of statements which always execute sequentially or operations that are applied to each item in an iterable. Yet programs frequently need to be more subtle with their behavior. For example, a messaging app might only set a message's title bold if it has not been read by the user. Or a video game needs to update the position of all the characters that are not asleep. This is done with something called a **selection** or a **conditional statement**.

This chapter will further detail how to use conditional statements.

Learning Goals
--------------

* To understand boolean expressions and logical operators
* To understand conditional execution
* To be able to write a boolean function
* To know when to use binary, unary, chained and nested conditional statements


Objectives
----------

* To properly evaluate a (compound) boolean expression
* To use parenthesis to properly demonstrate operator precedence
* To use conditional statements to properly branch code
